# INFO 201 Final Project: Mortality Rates
### Created By Nile Picnic Squirrels(Group AB3): Thiemo Loos, Hongyang Zhang, Jason Suh, Igor Banin

Introduction
The data set we are using is mortality rates in the United States by substance abuse disorders
and intentional injurious collected by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Institute
for Health Metrics of the University of Washington. This data uses US census data for populations
as a base to form mortality rates based on total individual reported cases. We will also be using
the complete data set from the US census that this report uses for further demographic, socio-economic,
and other features of county populations to find deeper trends. This is needed to truly find the potential
reasons behind the dataâs mortality rates. The main mortality data set includes information from
1980-2014. This includes mortality rates by state and county. It also breaks down the causes of
mortality by county with a FIPS number attached to that county. This provides vital information that
will aid us in being able to visually map this data, which can help us find initial geographic trends
to further explore. Past geographic data the only demographic segmentation of by gender, which is why
we are including other census data. The domain knowledge for this project will be understanding the most
common types of mortalities in the United States and how certain population features can impact these
types in order to have a starting place for our analysis. This will be through researching causes for
these types through government reports on public policy and its past effects on population health.
This system will allow you to look through our analysis on four core problems listed in the next tabs.
You can filter the data visualizations by state, year, and mortality where it is appropriate.

Questions
1. As this data set contains the lives of those in different generations is there any
major difference between the mortality rates and types for each generation? What could
some of the historical events or factors that could have contributed to this correlations?

2. Are there high concentration regions of certain mortality types and do these
concentrated areas have noticeable ripple effects in surrounding states? In
other words, does the mortality rate of a single state affect those of its
neighboring states? What are the possible factors contributing to the
results.

3. Do mortality rate and economic prosperity have an effect on each other?
The two seem unrelated, but are they actually similar or do they have a
relationship to each other? Correlation between socio-economics and how
wealth affects overall mortality rates for populations (are wealthier
populations less prone to death overall/to certain types?)

4. Over the past 20 years, with increases in mental illness/disorder awareness
and treatment, is there a decrease in self-harm mortality? How many health
bills have been passed in a given year and how much on average has each bill
changed the rate? Given some bills need time to ramp up, what is this overall
change based on current overall number of bills?
