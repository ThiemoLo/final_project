                      for Health Metrics of the University of Washington. This data uses US census data for populations
                      as a base to form mortality rates based on total individual reported cases. We will also be using
                      the complete data set from the US census that this report uses for further demographic, socio-economic,
                      and other features of county populations to find deeper trends. This is needed to truly find the potential
                      reasons behind the dataâ€™s mortality rates. The main mortality data set includes information from
                      1980-2014. This includes mortality rates by state and county. It also breaks down the causes of
                      mortality by county with a FIPS number attached to that county. This provides vital information that
                      will aid us in being able to visually map this data, which can help us find initial geographic trends
                      to further explore. Past geographic data the only demographic segmentation of by gender, which is why
                      we are including other census data. The domain knowledge for this project will be understanding the most
                      common types of mortalities in the United States and how certain population features can impact these
                      types in order to have a starting place for our analysis. This will be through researching causes for
                      these types through government reports on public policy and its past effects on population health.
